# Achtung

Achtung is an Android application designed for improving German pronunciation using Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology. The app allows users to enter German text, select their preferred German voice (from those available on their device), and adjust the speech rate to practice and perfect pronunciation. 

Future versions will offer translation capabilities to and from German, leveraging state-of-the-art language models.
